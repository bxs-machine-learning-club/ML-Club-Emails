# ML-Club-Emails
This is the email setup for the club fancy email. Do not do this on your own because you will spam the rest of the club. :-)
If the admins alert you that you can send an email, you can do this but in the meantime, play around with it on your own!

## How to use:
1. Download the newst version of the repo as a ZIP file and unpack it.
1. Open send_email.py in IDLE and change the contactsPath, messagePath, and templatePath to match the paths of the contacts.csv, message42120.txt, and email_template.html respectively.
1. Edit message42120.txt to say whatever you wish (remember that PERSON_NAME refers to, well, the person's name).
1. Go to Command Prompt (or Terminal if you are on OSX or Linux).
1. Follow the prompts to enter in your Bronx Science email, Bronx Science password and the subject of the email.

That's it!
