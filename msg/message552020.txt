Good evening ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
I hope everyone had a nice weekend. We will be having a ML Club Meeting 
<b>tomorrow</b>, Cinco De Mayo, at 4 PM EST. We will be covering <b>your</b>
requested topic of doing a full introduction on CNNs 
(convolutional neural networks). Like normal meetings,
this meeting will be a combination of presentation and colab notebook exercise
with CNNs so you can practice your knowledge.
<br>
The colab can be found <a href="https://tinyurl.com/cnn-colab">here</a>.
One important thing is that the 'Master' parts of the colab are only if 
you get stuck! Try finishing the assignments before you look at the code 
or ask Michael for help if needed.
<br><br>
See you all then,
<br>
ML Club
