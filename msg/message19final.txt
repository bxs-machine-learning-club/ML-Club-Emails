Hello ${PERSON_NAME},
<br><br>
I hope you had a great weekend despite the unrest throughout the U.S.
Don't let that discourage you though as the ML Club will be having its 
<b><i>FINAL</b></i> meeting tomorrow at 4 pm. We will be playing games like
<a href=https://skribbl.io">Skribbl.io</a> and perhaps <a href="
https://allbad.cards">Cards Against Humanity</a> (I am bad at inappropriate
humor). If you have any games you want us to play, suggest it in the meeting
tomorrow. We'll have a grand old time.
<br><br>
Of course, if you want to do something educational, suggest
it as well.  We can also teach you
some ML stuff during the meeting. That was what school was, was it?
<br> <br>
See you at 4!
<br>
ML Club
