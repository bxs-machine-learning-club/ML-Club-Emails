Good evening ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
Tomorrow the ML Club will be hosting the elections for next year's club 
positions. This is a very important event for the future of the club and 
to allow it to prosper. As a result, here is how election day
will work. <br>
<br>
Candidates who are running will go in the order of <b> VP of Outreach &
Marketing </b> followed by <b> VP of Curriculum & Learning, Chief of Creative
Content </b> and then <b> Secretary </b>. Candidates should have their 
speeches prepared and be ready to speak for <b> 4.5 minutes per speech </b> with 
an optional Q & A and presentation following the speech, depending 
on the position.  Michael will keep time and will announce a 30 second warning
at 4 minutes and "TIME UP" at 4.5 mins. The candidate picked first will be
<i> completely random</i>. <br> <br>
This time, the club will meet at our <a href="https://hangouts.google.com/group/sATL2JV5XMaWCMiP9">hangouts</a>
from 5 PM - 6 PM. However, the most important thing is that only <b> regularly
attending members </b> (those who met in the club before school closed) can vote in the 
election. You cannot vote for yourself. Michael, the future president 
 (the one writing this
email), will be able to vote as well. <br><br>
At the end, we will tally votes with our advisor(Dr. Gensert) and see who
will get a position. <br><br>
Hope to see you there, <br><br>
ML Club
