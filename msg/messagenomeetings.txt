Good evening ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
I hope you had a great weekend. Due to AP exams this week and the next, the
ML Club will not be having meetings for the next two weeks. We will resume
meetings on Tues 5/26. Good luck on your exams.
<br> <br>
If you would like to practice your ML skills until our meeting, you can
complete the GitHub challenges posted on our GitHub or complete the CNN
neural network notebook from our last meeting.
<br> <br>
