Good evening ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
<strong> IGNORE THE LAST EMAIL SENT </strong>
<br> <br>
We hope you are doing well and are having a great weekend. In addition to our
next meeting on <strong> this Tuesday </strong> on an introduction to 
machine learning in artificial intelligence, we would like everyone who 
attended our first meeting to fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvE3sbLs7ohKeLHr4rpcV6yzI0rOdGlqHHi4PPIovDX8x_7w/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&flr=0&usp=mail_form_link" target="_blank"> this </a> form so
we can properly record our attendance for last meeting. We will stop asking
you of this once the official attendance forms for clubs starts coming out.
<br> <br>
Thanks for your cooperation and we hope to see you at our next meeting,
<br> <br>
ML Club
