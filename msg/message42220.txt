Dear ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
I have an amazing opportunity for everyone. Major League Hacking has just 
announced that it will be hosting a hackathon every weekend in the summer
starting May 2nd. It is an amazing opportunity to be in a hackathon to test 
your machine learning skills. The first hackathon is called "Hack At Home" 
starting May 2nd at 10 am so be sure to do it to test your skills.
