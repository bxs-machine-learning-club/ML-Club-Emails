I hope you are doing well today. Here are some interesting opportunities that you guys might be interested in.
<br> <br>
1. Mark Cuban (one of the investors in <i>Shark Tank</i> is giving an introductory class on Machine Learning for beginners on April 15, 2020 from 7:00 pm to 8:30 pm.

<br> <br>
2. Do you want to participate in an online hackathon. If you do, THIS Saturday from 9 am to 9 pm, come to Local Hack Day: Share."https://localhackday.mlh.io/share". There will be tons of workshops and it is a great opportunity given that there are no hackathons in operation because of the virus. See you there!
<br> <br>
<br> <br>
All the best,
<br> <br>
