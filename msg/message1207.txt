Hello ${PERSON_NAME},
<br>
I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. The ML Club will be having
a meeting at 3:45 pm EST tomorrow further discussing Python! Furthermore, we
will be having our <strong> first demo day </strong> in one week! If you want
to present one of the projects you have been working on, let us know in the
<a href="https://discord.gg/g6XWJbryZN">ML Club Discord</a> so we can give you
time to present your project. If you are advanced in Python, Michael might
even give you a potential project idea to create your own AI vs AI game!
<br>
See you tomorrow and stay tuned for Michael's cool project idea,
<br>
ML Club
