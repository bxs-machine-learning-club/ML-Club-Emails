Hello ${PERSON_NAME},
<br> <br>
I hope you are doing well amongst the quarantine and had a great Memorial Day
weekend. This is just a reminder that the ML Club will be having a meeting
tomorrow 5/26/20 at 4 pm. Since we are winding down the number of meetings
we are having, we want YOU to choose what we do this meeting until we 
close the club for the summer. The link is <a href

respond by tomorrow!!!
<br> <br>
Furthermore, we have created a YouTube channel that we highly recommend you
look at. It is simply called <b> Bx Sci Machine Learning Club </a>. Both Mike
and Zach have posted videos on it and we hope you learn from them!
<br> <br>

See you tom,
<br>
ML Club
